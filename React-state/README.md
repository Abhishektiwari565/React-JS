### 1️⃣ **State Initialization**

```javascript
const [count, setcount] = useState(0);
```

Here we store the current number (`count`) and have a function (`setcount`) to update it.
📌 Starts from **0** by default.

### 2️⃣ **Functions for Operations**

Each function updates the count value:

* `add()` ➡️ Adds 1
* `sub()` ➡️ Subtracts 1
* `mul()` ➡️ Multiplies by 2
* `divide()` ➡️ Divides by 2

* **Displays** the count 📟
* **4 buttons** for each operation 🖱️
